{"name":"Tictactoe-captcha","tagline":"Gamification and Captcha. The captcha that doesn't hurt! ","body":"### Tic Tac Toe CAPTCHA.\r\nPlaying game or struggling about how hard the captcha is! Robots are still stupid to understand human games and captcha-bots are trying to read scratched words, so we can have some fun while robots are trying to find out what to read, what to write and which botton to press.\r\n\r\n### Adding to the web page\r\nit's fairly simple. Just `include` or `iframe` the index file, and the rest will do the job. When user clicked on the right botton, the code will check and redirect user to the address you set in `redirect.php`. You can also recheck $_SESSION['result'] to see if its set to 1 (right answer) or 0 (wrong answer).\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nReason is simple! I hate that robots are smarter than me on guessing the normal `text-based` captcha. I want to prove that ***I'm smarter***.\r\n\r\n### By the way\r\nOnce Linus Torvalds (@torvalds) said: \"If it's not fun, Why do it?\"\r\nIf signing into my website is not fun, how can i ask them to do it?\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
